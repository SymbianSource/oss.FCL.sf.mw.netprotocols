# Comment can follow the 'endscript' marker

# Note that items in the [Defaults] section are applied to every section that follows; ie. they
# provide default 'global' settings.  They may be overridden in individual sections as desired.
# 
# Scripts can also included by using a [Scripts] section. The scripts must be in the same location
# as the including script and the test cases will be included at the same point the [Scripts] section.
# Any number of scripts can also be included and mulitple levels is supported. The defaults sections
# of a script file will only apply to the test cases in that file.
# eg
# [Scripts]
# 1= script2.ini
# 2= script3.ini
#
# Hence to disable a particular test, set 'RunTest= 0' in the section for that test. (note the SP)
#
# Iter 1 test 13 is diabled because is causes a panic
# Iter 2 POST tests 14 and 18 are disabled because they haven't been written yet
